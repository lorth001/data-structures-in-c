# Data Structures in C

A collection of programs I built to practice my conceptual knowledge of data structures (DS).  Each program focuses on a particular, well-known DS and implements it from scratch in the C language.

## Why C?

For several reasons.

1. It's not already prepackaged with a lot of data structures
2. It requires memory management
3. I wanted to live dangerously

## How to Use

Each program contains it's own README with information on how to use it.
