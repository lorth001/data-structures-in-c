# Data Structures in C

A collection of programs that implement common, well-known data structure in the classic C language.

## Why C?

For several reasons.

1. It's not prepackaged with a lot of data structures
2. It requires memory management
3. I wanted to live dangerously

## How to Use

Each program contains it's own README with information on how to use it.
